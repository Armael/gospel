Starting Example
================

As a warmup example, we use Gospel to provide formal specification to a mutable
queue data structure (adapted from `this FM'19 paper <https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02157484>`_).

First, we shall define the type of queues. Following the OCaml convention, we
use ``'a t`` to represent a polymorphic queue, storing elements of type ``'a``. In
order to be able to reason about the elements of a queue, we attach to its type
declaration a *model field*, as follows:

.. code-block:: ocaml

   type 'a t
   (*@ mutable model view: 'a seq *)

Comments of the form ``(*@`` introduce a Gospel annotation. Here, model ``view``
represents the mathematical sequence of elements stored in the queue. Type ``'a
seq`` is the type of logical sequences, defined in the Gospel standard library,
and is usable only for specification. Finally, the ``mutable`` keyword states
that the ``view`` field can change over time.
This is a first manifestation of how Gospel
annotations provide extra insight to the OCaml programmer: the ``mutable``
specification states that type  ``'a t`` stands for a mutable data type,
which can not be deduced from its declaration alone.

Let us now declare and specify a ``push`` operation for the queue data
structure. First, we write the OCaml type (function signature) then the Gospel
specification, as follows:

.. code-block:: ocaml

   val push: 'a -> 'a t -> unit
   (*@ push v q
         modifies q
         ensures  q.view = Seq.cons v (old q.view) *)

The first line of the specification names the two arguments of
``push``, as ``v`` and ``q``, respectively. Next, the ``modifies``
states that function ``push`` may mutate the contents of
``q``. Finally, the ``ensures`` clause introduces a postcondition. In
this case, it describes the ``view`` model of ``q`` , after a call to
``push``, as the extension of the old value of ``view`` with element
``v`` in front. One uses the keyword ``old`` to refer to the value of
some expression (here, ``q.view``) in the pre-state, *i.e.*, before
the function call.
Note that module ``Seq`` is part of the Gospel standard library, and
is not to be confused with module ``Seq`` from the OCaml standard library.

Let us know move to another function, to pop an element from the queue.
Following the OCaml standard library idioms, this function raises an
``Empty`` exception on an empty queue. We specify this behavior as follows:

.. code-block:: ocaml

   exception Empty

   val pop: 'a t -> 'a
   (*@ v = pop q
         modifies q
         raises   Empty -> q.view = old q.view = empty
         ensures  old q.view = q.view ++ Seq.cons v empty *)

Here, we have two postconditions. The first one, introduced with
``raises``, states the postcondition that holds whenever exception
``Empty`` is raised. The second one, introduced with ``ensures``,
states the postcondition that holds whenever function ``pop`` returns
a value ``v``. As with function ``push``, the clause ``modifies``
indicates that ``q`` may be mutated by this function call. Note that
this applies to the exceptional case as well, and that's why we state
that ``q`` is both empty and not modified.

An alternative would be ...

.. code-block:: ocaml

   val pop: 'a t -> 'a
   (*@ v = pop q
       requires q.view <> empty
       modifies q
       ensures  old q.view = q.view ++ (Seq.cons v empty) *)


.. code-block:: ocaml

   val is_empty: 'a t -> bool
   (*@ b = is_empty q
         ensures b <-> q.view = empty *)

.. todo::

   `is_empty` is interesting because it is an effect-free function

.. code-block:: ocaml

    val create : unit -> 'a t
    (** Return a new queue, initially empty. *)
    (*@ q = create ()
          ensures q.view = empty *)

.. todo::

   `concat`: should we show all the free variants? It could be interesting in
   order to showcase the expressiveness of Gospel to cope with different
   programming scenarios.

Cameleer
~~~~~~~~

Cameleer is a tool for the deductive verification for OCaml code. It takes as
input an OCaml programm, annotated with Gospel specification, and translates it
into an equivalent WhyML counterpart.

Following the Baker's approach, we encode a queue using a pair of lists to store
its elements. We begin by declaring the following type definition:

.. code-block:: ocaml

   type 'a t = {
     mutable front: 'a list;
     mutable rear : 'a list;
     mutable size : int;
     mutable view : 'a list [@ghost];
   } (*@ invariant size = length view *)
     (*@ invariant (front = [] -> rear = []) &&
                   view = front ++ List.rev rear *)

.. todo::

   change the type of field `view` to a sequence

This type is equipped with an invariant...

Simple operations over queues, the `create` and `is_empty` functions, as
follows:

.. code-block:: ocaml

   let create () = {
     front = [];
     rear  = [];
     size  = 0;
     view  = [];
   } (*@ q = create ()
           ensures q.view = [] *)

   let [@logic] is_empty q = q.size = 0
   (*@ b = is_empty q
         ensures b <-> q.view = [] *)

A more interesting function, the `push` ...

.. code-block:: ocaml

   let push x q =
     if is_empty q then q.front <- [x] else q.rear <- x :: q.rear;
     q.size <- q.size + 1;
     q.view <- q.view @ (x :: [])
   (*@ push x q
         ensures q.view = (old q.view) @ [x] *)

.. todo::

   change the `push` operation to follow the queue model of the FM'19 paper
