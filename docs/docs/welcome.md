# Welcome!

Welcome to the Gospel documentation. We provide several resources
to get you started with formal specifications of your OCaml programs.

- If you are entirely new to Gospel, please head out to the [Getting
  Started](getting-started/installation) section. You'll learn how to install
  Gospel, and write your first specification with it.
- The [Walk-through](walkthroughs/introduction) section showcases real-world OCaml
  interfaces, with a comprehensive explanation of the specification process and
  language features.
- More detailed explanations of the language features are available in the
  [Language Specification](language/locations) section.
- Short questions sometimes deserve short answers. You can also head out to the
  [FAQ](faq) section for common questions you may have about Gospel's design,
  semantics and features.

We are dedicated to making Gospel an easy-to-use specification language for
OCaml developers. Any comment or suggestion on the language or its documentation
is welcome, please feel free to [open a
discussion](https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/gospel/discussions/new) on Github to
share your ideas or questions.
